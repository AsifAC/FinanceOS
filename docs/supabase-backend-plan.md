## Project

- Supabase URL: https://zmbyqstmgtdbyvczuvki.supabase.co
- Backend rebuild status: local foundation setup only
- Clean checkpoint: `e435950 chore: reset Supabase backend foundation`

## Current Status

- Public tables: not created yet
- Public RLS policies: not created yet
- Storage buckets: not created yet
- Edge functions: not created yet
- Public database functions/triggers: not created yet
- Frontend screens remain on the existing local/mock data path

## Integration Order

1. Auth
2. Profiles
3. User preferences
4. Categories
5. Payment methods
6. Transactions
7. Expected transactions
8. Savings goals
9. Debts
10. Dashboard calculations
11. Reports
12. Budget snapshots
13. Archived budgets
14. PDF exports/storage
15. Notifications

## Planned Tables

Tables are planned but not created yet:

- profiles
- user_preferences
- categories
- payment_methods
- transactions
- expected_transactions
- savings_goals
- debts
- budget_snapshots
- archived_budgets
- notifications

## Planned Storage Buckets

Storage buckets are planned but not created yet:

- pdf-exports
- user-imports

## RLS Pattern

- Every user-owned table must enable RLS before frontend integration.
- Policies should scope row access to `auth.uid()` and the owning user column.
- Reads, inserts, updates, and deletes should be explicit per table and per workflow.
- Public unauthenticated access should not be added unless a specific product requirement is approved.

## Safety Rules

- Never use or request the Supabase service role key for frontend work.
- Never place `service_role` keys in Vite env files, browser code, commits, docs examples, or screenshots.
- Use only frontend-safe variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- `.env.local` should remain gitignored and machine-specific.

## Preview Mode Separation

- Mock/preview mode must remain separate from real Supabase data.
- Preview mode state must not write to live Supabase tables or storage.
- Real Supabase reads/writes should be introduced one workflow at a time after its schema, RLS policies, tests, and rollback path are documented.
